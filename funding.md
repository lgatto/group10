Making the case for funding a software developer
================================================

Scope: all funding sources. RCUK, EU

Why full time?
--------------

* Hard to find someone who will work part time.
* May not be a pool of people around to do part time
* Flexibility can help convince funders?
* Front/back loading can be useful
* Up to peer-review to decide whether full or part time best

Why is it hard to make the case?
--------------------------------

* Mixed community: peer reviewers may not be in software-driven research
* The "technician" question.
* What level to cost at?

Who has tried
-------------

PF tried.
Chaste group has one, funded through various grants (Knowledge transfer fellowship.)
 Works on one thing.
 
DI vs DA?
---------

.1 FTE...
DI can be better for track record?
But DA if there's a resource pool.

Tricks
------

Post-award
Archer eCSE -- and general non-Archer call coming.
Regional infrastructures
RA repurposed...
Cost as an external contractor?
Suggested reviewers?
Make sure you're registered with the research areas field in JeS. 
  They use this to find reviewers (Pledge.)

Where to put it in the grant?
-----------------------------

Link to data management?
Work plan, track record
Pathways to impact
