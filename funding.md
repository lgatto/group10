Making the case for funding a software developer
================================================

Scope: all funding sources. RCUK, EU

Name of Chair: Philip Fowler

Name of Scribe: James Hetherington

What are the five most important things learnt during this discussion:

1. Both full and part time are valid options
2. Both DI and DA can work
3. Include track record of engineers if possible
4. Look at examples of successful grants
5. Use pathways to impact section to talk about justification

What are the problems, and are there solutions?
===============================================

Problems:
---------

* Mixed community: peer reviewers may not be in software-driven research
* The "technician" question.
* What level to cost at?
* Hard to get people to do part time
* But front/back loading can be useful

Solutions/tricks:
-----------------

* Post-award
* Archer eCSE -- and general non-Archer call coming.
* Regional infrastructures
* RA repurposed...
* Cost as an external contractor?
* Suggested reviewers?
* Use juicy job titles.

What further work could be done, and who should do it (make a pledge)?
======================================================================

Make sure you're registered with the research areas field in JeS. 
  They use this to find reviewers (Pledge.)
  Also H2020 call for reviewers.
  In free text keywords under classification of oneself in JeS, include "Research
Software Engineer" and "Software Developer".
  
Community-curated repository of evidence. (SSI/UKRSE)

Are there any useful resources that people should know about?
=============================================================

Other notes
===========

Why full time?
--------------

* Hard to find someone who will work part time.
* May not be a pool of people around to do part time
* Flexibility can help convince funders?
* Up to peer-review to decide whether full or part time best

Who has tried
-------------

PF tried.
Chaste group has one, funded through various grants (Knowledge transfer fellowship.)
 Works on one thing.
 
DI vs DA?
---------

.1 FTE...
DI can be better for track record?
But DA if there's a resource pool.

Where to put it in the grant?
-----------------------------

Link to data management?
Work plan, track record
