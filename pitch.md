Readmycode: Code review buddy finder
====================================

Context
-------

A: I'm a researcher who programs. I know my code could be better, 
but I don't know how to start finding out what I could improve and how. 
I want to find people to show my code to.

B: I run a code journal. I want to find programming researchers who are
qualified to review submissions.

Problem
-------

Given:
  A link to my code
  A description of me as a researcher
Find:
  Other researchers who work
     in similar fields
     OR with similar techniques
     AND in the same programming language
     
Solution
--------

From: 
  * A git/hg repo or github URL
  * An ORCID or userid on academia.edu or Web of Science or similar

Use existing online searches and data to match and search.
